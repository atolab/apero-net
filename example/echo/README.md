## TCP Echo Service
This example illustrate the use of the **Apero** TcpService to create a classic
echo service that repeats what is written to it.

To test it try, start the service:

$ echo.exe 


While on another terminal you can use the *nc* command to send string to the service 
and see then sent back to you.
